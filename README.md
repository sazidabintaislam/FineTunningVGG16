## *VGG16 Fine-Tuning with camera trap images*  

### Description: This file describes steps on how to use trained model to predicts species from camera trap images.          

#### Finename: 

*VGG16_finetune1.ipynb* = Fine-tune both the final set of CONV layers and our set of FC layers in VGG16. In this model, the final CONV layer block is unfreezen and new FC layer has been added as classifier.

*Dataset*: Snake Vs Background (Dataset are not publicly available)
